    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <h3>PURPOSE</h3>
    <p>The purpose for this website is to create a simple and easy to read landing
        page for customers to see the different types of excursions we offer. As we 
        have many beginners, we would also like an educational page about the experience, 
        like what to expect and safety information so that everyone can feel confident 
        as they book their white water rafting tour.
    </p>

    <h3>AUDIENCE</h3>
    <p>Our customers have extra money to spend on excursions. They have an active lifestyle 
        and are either beginners at white water rafting and need all of the equiptment and 
        a tour guide, or they are experienced rafters who just want to rent equiptment. 
        We are located in Idaho in Hells Canyon on the Snake River, and have both local customers 
        and vacationers who love the mountains and adventure. There is another company up 
        here with really high prices, so we would like to offer and equally exciting and safe 
        experience for a more affordable price while still making money. The customer base 
        is often younger and will be accessing the content mostly on their mobile devices, 
        but desktops and laptops will be used as well.
