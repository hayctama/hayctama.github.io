    <h2>(Bryn)</h2>
    <p>I have three handsome little boys with another one on the way,
        and a wonderful husband keeping us all sane! We enjoy riding bikes
        and playing sports together. I have been a member my entire life.
        D&C 50:41 is a favorite scripture of mine about overcoming the world.
        I love the quote from President Nelson, "The joy we feel has little to do
        with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives."</p>
    <p>I currently work in marketing and would like to expand to email marketing for
        our company which I need a degree and more computer and coding knowledge to do. I am excited to
        learn more about web fundamentals in this class. It will definitely help my
        effectiveness in email marketing to learn all of these basics. Already 
        this week with HTML and CSS intros I feel like I am getting a better
        understanding. The CSS video got me really excited. I love making things
        beautiful, and hope to use these skills in my professional life and maybe
        just for fun if I design a website for our family journal.</p>
    <p>I love that BYU-Idaho has the Pathway program. It has provided me with
        the oppurtunity to be here learning with you all. I am persuing a Software
        Development degree. I highly value relationships in work and school and look forward to
        getting to know each of you better as we help one another get the
        most out of this class! </p>
