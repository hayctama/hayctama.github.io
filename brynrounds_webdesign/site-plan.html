        OBJECTIVE
	      The main objective of this site is for the potential company or client to hire me to design their website. I can achieve this by making my site visually appealing and easy to read. There will need to be an aspect of selling myself in the text as well. However, I think the actual design part will be more telling than the resume and verbiage.

      </ul>
      <h3>RESUME</h3>
      <p>
        AUDIENCE
        The audience is definitely a potential company or client. So I need to understand what they are wanting to see. It may be helpful to talk to some small businesses and ask what they specifically want in a website designer. As many of these companies and clients scout around and are busy, I will want my website to be straightforward and easy to understand, with a strong emphasis on how I can serve them. A resume is pretty standard and may be something they want to skim, so having bolded headers will help them find what they are looking for. 	At this point in time while I am still slowly finishing up my degree and do not plan on instantly getting in the job market, I may even want to gear my site specifically towards small business owners who I already may know. Then in the future I can edit my website to be more geared towards companies when my kids are all in school, and I am ready to get a full time job.
      </p>
      <p>  
        AUDIENCE - WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE
        I believe having a website as my “resume” will give me an edge over other designers because it is like a resume and portfolio in one. They can see my work while getting to know who they are hiring. Generally when you are hiring someone you want to know basic resume info like where they went to school, their degree, and past work experience. Where website design is a service it is also good to form a personal relationship with those you are working for, so some about me information that they can actually care about or relate with, not just general info. I may want to consider my ideal clientele and not just make an about me for the masses. This is important to me as I want to design websites I actually have some interest in their topics.

      </ul>
      <h3>CONTACT</h3>
      <p>
        PAGES
        Having the home page as an instant about me page will get the process of them getting to now me started immediately. Along with links to the my other two pages, RESUME and CONTACT, in the header, I will also want to have them in the body of my home page / about me page so it makes it simple to click the next place I want them to go, and there is no guessing. This will make it more of an experience that I have control over so that they generally start at my 1. HOME PAGE/ABOUT ME - then move to 2. RESUME - finishing with 3. CONTACT (aka, contacting me to hire me.)
      </p>
      <p>  
        PAGES - IMAGES
        As far as images go, it is required to have 2 images per page. So a few of me and maybe a family picture would be a good starting point. I am not sure exactly what images I would organically include in a resume or contact page, but maybe I can even use them as icons or on the side to make my website more appealing. I could definitely have an image at the bottom with a link button next to is to send them on to the next page I want them to visit. The image can make the “call to action” a little more obvious.
